Description
This Python-based web scraping solution is built using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to automate the process of scraping websites. The script can be configured to scrape content (like titles, prices, links, etc.) from any website by simply modifying a configuration dictionary. It supports pagination and saves the extracted data to a CSV file.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Selenium: Automates web browsing (useful for JavaScript-rendered content)
BeautifulSoup: Parses HTML and extracts data
CSV: Stores the scraped data in a structured format
Features
Scrapes websites dynamically using configurable settings.
Handles pagination to scrape data from multiple pages automatically.
Saves scraped data into a CSV file for easy access.
Adaptable for any website by changing the configuration dictionary.
How to Use
Clone the repository (or download the script).

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-script.git
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
Download ChromeDriver:

You’ll need ChromeDriver to use Selenium. Download it from here and ensure it matches your browser version.
Place the ChromeDriver executable on your system and update the script with the correct path to the file.
Modify the configuration:

Open the script and modify the config dictionary to fit the website you want to scrape. The configuration includes:
base_url: URL pattern with placeholders for pagination.
content_selector: CSS selector to target content blocks (e.g., books, articles).
fields: Defines which elements to extract (e.g., title, price, link).
Example configuration for Books to Scrape:
python
Copy code
config = {
    "base_url": "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-{}.html",
    "start_page": 1,
    "pagination_limit": None,
    "content_selector": "article.product_pod",
    "fields": {
        "title": {"selector": "h3 a", "attribute": "title"},
        "price": {"selector": "p.price_color", "attribute": "text"},
        "link": {"selector": "h3 a", "attribute": "href"}
    },
    "output_file": "books_data.csv"
}
Run the script:

After modifying the configuration, run the script by executing:

bash
Copy code
python scraper.py
The script will scrape the data from the specified website and save it to a CSV file (e.g., books_data.csv).
View the output:

Open the generated CSV file (e.g., books_data.csv) in Excel or Google Sheets to view the scraped data (e.g., book titles, prices, and links).
Example Output
When scraping Books to Scrape, the script will generate a CSV file like this:

Title	Price	Link
A Light in the Attic	£51.77	/catalogue/a-light-in-the-attic_1000/index.html
Tipping the Velvet	£53.74	/catalogue/tipping-the-velvet_999/index.html
...	...	...
Customizing for Other Websites
To use this script on other websites, you need to modify the following settings in the config dictionary:

base_url: Change it to the URL structure for the website, including a placeholder for pagination (e.g., page-{}).
content_selector: Find the correct CSS selector for the items you want to scrape (e.g., product listings, blog posts).
fields: Define the fields you want to extract (e.g., title, price, URL).
For example, to scrape blog posts:

base_url: "http://example.com/blog/page-{}"
content_selector: "div.post"
fields: "title", "author", "date", "link"
Demo Walkthrough
Website: We'll use Books to Scrape (http://books.toscrape.com) as an example for this demo.

Process:

The script starts by scraping data from page 1 (URL: http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-1.html).
It extracts the title, price, and link of each book on the page.
After scraping page 1, it automatically moves to page 2 (page-2.html), scrapes the data, and repeats the process until all pages are scraped.
Output: After scraping all the pages, the script saves the data in a CSV file. The result is a structured table of book titles, prices, and links, which can be opened in Excel or Google Sheets.
